 HP Classic Calculator Battery Pack
 
 This is my attempt at a LiPo-based battery pack for "Classic" HP Calculators, specifically HP-35, HP-45, and HP-55.
 The idea is to use a PCB as the contact substrate, and 'hang' the LiPo cell from its underside. 
 Laser-cut 'endcaps' locate the assembly within the battery well.
