 HP Classic Calculator Battery Pack
 
 This is my attempt at a LiPo-based battery pack for "Classic" HP Calculators, specifically HP-35, HP-45, and HP-55.
 The idea is to use a PCB as the contact substrate, and 'hang' the LiPo cell from its underside. Laser-cut 'endcaps' locate the PCB and cell within the battery well.
 
 Endcaps in 3mm fiberboard ordered from Ponoko on 11/4/2020.
 PCB is not yet sent out for fabrication.
